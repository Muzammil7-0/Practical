% Base case: Move a single disk from X to Y
move(1, X, Y, _) :-
    write('Move top disk from '), write(X), write(' to '), write(Y), nl.

% Recursive case: Move N disks from X to Y using Z as auxiliary
move(N, X, Y, Z) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, X, Z, Y),  % Move M disks from X to Z using Y as auxiliary
    move(1, X, Y, _),  % Move the 1 remaining disk from X to Y
    move(M, Z, Y, X).  % Move M disks from Z to Y using X as auxiliary

% Example Output
?- move(3, 'A', 'C', 'B').
% Move top disk from A to C
% Move top disk from A to B
% Move top disk from C to B
% Move top disk from A to C
% Move top disk from B to A
% Move top disk from B to C
% Move top disk from A to C
